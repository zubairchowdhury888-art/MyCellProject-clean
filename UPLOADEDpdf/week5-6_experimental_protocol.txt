TITLE: Testing Syntactic Information Processing in Fungal Networks

OBJECTIVE: Verify whether Schizophyllum commune electrical spikes exhibit
           grammar-like structure and noise-resistant information encoding

MATERIALS:
----------
Biological:
  • Schizophyllum commune strain H4-8 (Utrecht) or ATCC 38548
  • S. commune minimal medium (SCMM): Dons et al. 1979 formulation
  • 1.5% agar, 90mm Petri dishes

Hardware:
  • Iridium-coated stainless steel subdermal electrodes (Spes Medica)
  • ADC-24 high-resolution data logger (Pico Technology) or 24-bit equivalent
  • 30°C incubator with stable temperature (±0.5°C)
  • Hot needle for creating electrode insertion holes

Software:
  • Python 3.8+ with numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib
  • Data acquisition software (Pico SDK or equivalent)
  • Analysis scripts (provided in GitHub repository)

PROCEDURE:
----------
Day 1-3: Culture Preparation
  1. Inoculate S. commune on SCMM agar plates
  2. Incubate at 30°C in dark for 72 hours
  3. Verify colony diameter >20mm before electrode insertion

Day 3: Electrode Insertion
  4. Using hot needle, melt 2-8 holes in Petri dish lid
  5. Insert electrode pairs through holes until touching agar
  6. Electrode spacing: 10mm within pairs, 20-30mm between pairs
  7. Seal around electrodes with lab wax/parafilm
  8. Return to incubator for 12-24 hour settling period

Day 4-10: Continuous Recording
  9. Connect electrodes to data logger (differential mode)
  10. Configure acquisition: 1 sample/second, 24-bit resolution
  11. Voltage range: ±78 mV (or nearest equivalent)
  12. Record continuously for minimum 48 hours (96+ hours preferred)
  13. Monitor for disconnections/artifacts

ANALYSIS PIPELINE:
------------------
Step 1: Spike Detection (Python)
  • Load raw voltage time series
  • Calculate derivative: dV/dt
  • Detect spikes: threshold dV/dt < -0.15 mV/s
  • Filter false positives: minimum 30s separation
  • Export spike times as CSV

Step 2: Information Theory Metrics
  • Shannon entropy: H = -Σ p(x) log₂ p(x)
    - Calculate at windows: 5s, 10s, 30s, 60s
    - Use binary spike/no-spike encoding

  • Kolmogorov complexity (approximation):
    - Compress spike train using gzip/zlib (level 9)
    - K ≈ compressed_size / original_size

  • Inter-spike interval (ISI) distribution:
    - Histogram with auto-binning
    - Calculate ISI entropy from bin probabilities

Step 3: Markov Baseline Comparison
  • Calculate empirical transition probabilities:
    P(spike→spike), P(spike→no-spike), etc.
  • Generate 20 Markov sequences using these probabilities
  • Calculate entropy/complexity for each Markov sequence
  • t-test: Compare actual vs Markov baseline (α=0.05)

Step 4: Cellular Automaton Models (optional replication)
  • Implement three 50×50 grid models:
    1. Random: p(activation) = 0.1
    2. Boolean: Conway-like majority voting
    3. Syntactic: Triplet majority decoding
  • Test noise levels: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%
  • Measure mutual information vs reference state
  • Compare degradation rates

EXPECTED RESULTS:
-----------------
If hypothesis is CORRECT:
  ✓ Shannon entropy: 4-5 bits (10s window)
  ✓ Kolmogorov complexity: 0.08-0.12 (85-95% compressible)
  ✓ Markov test: p > 0.05 (statistically similar to baseline)
  ✓ Syntactic model: >100× information capacity vs Boolean

If hypothesis is INCORRECT:
  ✗ Low entropy (<2 bits) indicating pure randomness
  ✗ High complexity (>0.5) indicating no redundancy
  ✗ Markov test: p < 0.05 (significantly different patterns)
  ✗ Syntactic model: no advantage over Boolean baseline
