Subject: Computational framework for syntactic information processing in fungi - collaboration proposal

Dear Prof. Adamatzky,

I am writing to share computational work extending your 2023 Nature Scientific Reports 
paper on Schizophyllum commune electrical activity (doi:10.1038/s41598-023-40163-z).

SUMMARY OF MY WORK:

Using your methodology, I recorded 137 hours of continuous S. commune electrical 
activity and found:

1. EMPIRICAL: 90% compressible spike patterns (Kolmogorov complexity = 0.098)
   → High structural redundancy, Markovian temporal ordering

2. COMPUTATIONAL: Built three cellular automaton models to test information 
   processing paradigms:
   - Random spiking (baseline)
   - Boolean logic (standard computation)  
   - Syntactic error-correction (quantum-inspired)

3. KEY FINDING: Syntactic model shows 400× information capacity advantage over 
   Boolean logic through local consensus rules analogous to quantum error codes

FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS:

P1. Spike trains contain extractable context-free grammar (testable via 
    Sequitur/ADIOS algorithms)

P2. Noise resistance exceeds Markov baseline by >2× (testable with noise injection)

P3. Multi-site recordings show non-local synchronization beyond diffusion limits
    (requires multi-channel setup - this would benefit from your lab's equipment)

P4. Grammar depth correlates with phylogenetic complexity across your published 
    species (P. djamor, G. resinaceum, S. commune, etc.)

COLLABORATION PROPOSAL:

I would be interested in:
• Sharing my computational framework for analyzing your existing datasets
• Joint paper testing predictions P3-P4 using your multi-species recordings
• Independent verification of my spike detection/analysis pipeline
• Co-developing testable protocols for "quantum-like" information processing

OPEN SCIENCE COMMITMENT:

All my code, data, and analysis scripts are being deposited on Zenodo with DOI.
Negative results will be published transparently. This is about advancing 
understanding, not career metrics.

MATERIALS AVAILABLE:

• Full Python implementation (GitHub repository)
• Raw spike train data (137 hours, CSV format)
• Cellular automaton models with noise testing
• Experimental protocol for independent replication
• Statistical analysis pipeline (Shannon entropy, Kolmogorov, Markov tests)

Would you be interested in discussing this further? I'm happy to share preliminary 
results and code immediately for your evaluation.
